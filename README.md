# work-day-scheduler

This web page is for keeping up with tasks throughout a given work day.  Each row is for a different hour of the day, with styling to indicate the current hour, as well as future and past hours.  When text is entered into the description areas, the save buttons can be used to save that text so that if the user exits the page and comes back, the text will remain as whatever was saved in that description area.
